 **🧮 AGE CALCULATOR 🧮**

This is a simple Age Calculator project developed in Python, utilizing the datetime module. With this program, you can calculate your exact age in years, months, and days based on your birthdate.

🎯 **OBJECTIVE:**

The goal of this project is to allow users to discover their exact age, not just in years, but also in months and days, up to the current date.

🖥 **TECHNOLOGIES USED:**

Python (version 3.x)
datetime module for handling and calculating dates and times.

🎉 **Example Output**

Enter your birthdate in dd/mm/yyyy format: 15/08/1995

Current date: 18/03/2025

Your birthdate: 15/08/1995

You are 29 years, 7 months, and 3 days old. Congratulations!


📝 **How It Works**

The program starts by importing the datetime module and fetching the current date.
Then, it prompts the user to input their birthdate.
The program calculates the difference between the current date and the birthdate, adjusting the values of years, months, and days.
Finally, the program prints the user's exact age in the format: "You are X years, Y months, and Z days old."
